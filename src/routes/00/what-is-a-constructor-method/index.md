## What is a constructor method

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "John";
  }
}

var employeeObject = new Employee();
console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
```
