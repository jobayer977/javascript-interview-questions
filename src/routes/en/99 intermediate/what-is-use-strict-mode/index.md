## What is use strict mode?

ECMAScript 5 introduced the concept of "strict mode" . It allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions . Its main purpose is to do more checking.

**With Strict Mode**

```javascript
    'use strict';
    username = 'Jon';
    console.log(username);
    // Uncaught ReferenceError: username is not defined
```
**WithOut Strict Mode**

```javascript
    username = 'Jon';
    console.log(username);
    //Jon
```
