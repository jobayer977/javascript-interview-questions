## How do higher order functions work ?

A function that receives another function as an argument or that returns a new function or both is called Higher-order functions. Higher-order functions are only possible because of the First-class function.

```js
   const greet =  function(name){
      return function(m){
      
         console.log(`Hi!! ${name}, ${m}`);
      }
   }
   
   const greet_message = greet('ABC');
   greet_message("Welcome To GeeksForGeeks")
```

We can also call the function like this also — greet(‘ABC’)(‘Welcome To GeeksForGeeks’), It will also give the same output.

```console
Hi!! ABC, Welcome To GeeksForGeeks
```
