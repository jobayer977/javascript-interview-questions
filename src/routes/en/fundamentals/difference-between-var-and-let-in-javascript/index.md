## Difference between var and let in JavaScript?  

The main difference between let and var is that scope of a variable defined with let is limited to the block in which it is declared while variable declared with var has the global scope. So we can say that var is rather a keyword which defines a variable globally regardless of block scope.

Also, one difference between var and let is variable with var can be redeclared to some other value while variable could not be redeclared if it is defined with let.
