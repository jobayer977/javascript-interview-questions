## Difference Between undefined and null ?

`undefined` is a variable that refers to something that doesn't exist, and the variable isn't defined to be anything. `null` is a variable that is defined but is missing a value.

```javascript
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null
```
