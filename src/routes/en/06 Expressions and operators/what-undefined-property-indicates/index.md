## What undefined property indicates?

A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.

```javascript
    let x;
    if (typeof x === 'undefined') {
    // these statements execute
    }
```
