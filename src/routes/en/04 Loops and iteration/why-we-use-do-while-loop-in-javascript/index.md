## Why we use do while loop in JavaScript?

The do..while loop is the variant of the while loop. It's executed once before checking the condition is true. Then it will repeat the condition as long as the condition is true.

```javascript
let number = 1;

do {
 number++;
 console.log(number);
} while (number < 10);

```
