## What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript ?

A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.

```js
    function somemethod() {
        console.log(counter1); // undefined
        console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
        var counter1 = 1;
        let counter2 = 2;
    }
```
