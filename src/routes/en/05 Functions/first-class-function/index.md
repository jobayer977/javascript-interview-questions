## What is the first-class function in Javascript?

A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

**Example**

```js
    function sayHello() {
    return "Hello, ";
    }
    function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
    console.log(helloMessage() + name);
    }
    // Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
    greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");
    // Hello, JavaScript!
```
