## Differences between Objects and Maps ?

### 1. Keys on objects are strings, on maps keys are of any type

Indeed objects are collections of key-value pairs but the key can only be a string. While the key of a Map can be of any type.

If for example, we use a number as a key in an object literal, that number is converted to a string and used as the key.

Because the key is converted to a string we get the same result when trying to get value for the 1 number value or for the '1' string value.  

```js  
    const obj = {
        1: 'One',
    }
    console.log(obj[1]) // One

    const map = new Map()
    map.set(1, 'One')
    console.log(map.get(1)) // One
    console.log(map.get('1')) // undefined
```  

When using maps the key can be of any type so the 1 number key is different from the '1' string key

```js  
    const map = new Map()
    map.set(1, 'One')
    console.log(map.get(1)) // One
    console.log(map.get('1')) // undefined
```  

The key is unique in both cases. There cannot be two properties in an object with the same key or two entries in a map with the same key.  

### 2. Maps preserve the order of their keys, objects do not

The original order of key-value pairs is preserved in maps, while in objects it is not.

```js  
    const gamesObj = {
    2: 'Tzolkin',
    1: 'Citadels',
    };
    const keys = Object.keys(gamesObj);
    console.log(keys);
    //["1", "2"];
    const keyValuePairs = Object.entries(gamesObj);
    console.log(keyValuePairs);
    //["1", "Citadels"]
    //["2", "Tzolkin"]
```  

Notice that when the object is created the key 2 comes before the key 1. When retrieving all the keys 2 comes after 1.

Below is a similar collection built with the Map constructor. This time the initial order is preserved.

```js  
    const gamesMap = new Map([
    [2, 'Tzolkin'],
    [1, 'Citadels']
    ])
    const keys = gamesMap.keys();
    console.log(keys);
    //MapIterator {2, 1}
    const keyValuePairs = gamesMap.entries();
    console.log(keyValuePairs);
    //MapIterator {2 => "Tzolkin", 1 => "Citadels"}

```
