title: How can access an object's  values?
---

There are two ways to access an object's values. One is using the dot notation and the other is using the bracket notation.

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'John',
	age: 30
};

// Dot notation
console.log(person.name);

// Bracket notation
console.log(person['name']);
```
