title: What does it mean that JavaScript is "dynamic"?

JavaScript is called a dynamic language because it doesn't just have a few dynamic aspects, pretty much everything is dynamic.

All variables are dynamic (both in type and existance), and even the code is dynamic. You can create new variables at runtime, and the type of variables is determined at runtime
