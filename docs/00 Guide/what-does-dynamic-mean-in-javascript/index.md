title: What does dynamic mean in JavaScript?
---

JavaScript is a loosely typed or dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

```javascript
let age = 50; // age is a number now
age = 'old'; // age is a string now
age = true; // age is a boolean
```
