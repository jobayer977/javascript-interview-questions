## What is scope of variable in JavaScript ?

The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

- **Global Variables** − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code
- **Local Variables** − A local variable will be visible only within a function or block (let,const) where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function
