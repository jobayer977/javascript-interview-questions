## How does a web browser work

Browser is a program that runs in the background and is responsible for rendering the web page. When a web page is requested, the browser sends a request to the server. The server then sends the web page back to the browser. When the web browser fetches data from an internet connected server, it uses a piece of software called a rendering engine to translate that data into text and images. This data is written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and web browsers read this code to create what we see, hear and experience on the internet.
