title: How to check whether there is a specific value in the Array?
---

There are many ways we can determine where a specific value exists in the target array. The `includes` method in Javascript is one of the most convenient ways to find out whether a value exists in an array or not.

**Example**

```javascript
if (numbers.includes(3)) {
	console.log('found it');
}
```
