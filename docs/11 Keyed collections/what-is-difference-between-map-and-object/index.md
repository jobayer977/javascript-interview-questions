title: What is difference between Map and Object?
---

Map is a data structure which helps in storing the data in the form of pairs. The pair consists of a unique key and a value mapped to the key. It helps prevent duplicity.
Object follows the same concept as that of map i.e. using key-value pair for storing data. But there are slight differences which makes map a better performer in certain situations.

Few basic differences are as follows:

- In Object, the data-type of the key-field is restricted to integer, strings, and symbols. Whereas in Map, the key-field can be of any data-type (integer, an array, even an object!)
- In the Map, the original order of elements is preserved. This is not true in case of objects.
