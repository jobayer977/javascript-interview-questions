## what is arrow function?

Arrow function is a function expression that has a shorter syntax than function declaration. And it is also a function expression that has no name. Arrow function does not have own this, arguments, super, or new.target.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
 return a + b;
}

const add = (a, b) => {
 return a + b;
};

```
