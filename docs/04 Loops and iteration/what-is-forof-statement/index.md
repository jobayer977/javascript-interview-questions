## What is for...of statement

The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object. It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}

// BMW
// Volvo
// Mini
```
