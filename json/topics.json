Variables declared anywhere within the switch statement is locally scoped to the switch statement.\n\n```js\n    let number  = 2;\n\n    switch (number) {\n        case 1: \n            let message = \"first number\";\n            console.log(message)\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            let message = \"second number\";\n            console.log(message)\n            break;\n    case 3:\n            let message = \"third number\";\n            console.log(message)\n            break;\n        default\n            let message = \"second number\";\n            console.log(message)\n            break;\n    }\n\n    //This throws a syntax error: identifier \"message\" \n    //has already been declared\n```\n\nThere are cases where you might need yo hold different variable values in each of the case statements. It's possible to keep a variable scoped to the case statement. There's a very easy fix for this, Let's solve this\n\n```js\n    let number  = 2;\n\n    switch (number) {\n        case 1: { // braces make the case statement a block\n            let message = \"number\" + number; // this remains in this block\n            console.log(message)\n            break;\n        }\n        case 2: {\n            let message =  \"number\" + number; // this is a valid syntax\n            console.log(message)\n            break;\n        }\n        case 3: {\n            let message = \"number\" + number; \n            console.log(message)\n            break;\n        }\n        default\n            let message =  \"number\" + number;\n            console.log(message)\n            break;\n    }\n```\n\nBy wrapping a block in braces, any variable declared within that block is only visible within the block,and is garbage collected once the block ends.\n\nWith this syntax, each of these variables are declared within a block, scoped away from each other. They can only be accessed from within the case scope and thrown away once the block ends.\n\n[Reference](https://dev.to/robogeek95/scoping-variables-in-the-switch-statement-1gig)\n","section":"03 Control flow"},{"title":"What are falsy values in JavaScript?","content":"## What are falsy values in JavaScript?\n\nThose are Essentials falsy values in Javascript.\n\n```javascript\nfalse\nundefined\nnull\nNaN\n0\n+0\n-0\n\"\"\n''\n``\n```\n","section":"03 Control flow"},{"title":"What is strict mode?","content":"## What is strict mode?\n\nStrict mode is a way to tell the JavaScript engine to be more strict when running your code.

Keys on objects are strings, on maps keys are of any type\n\nIndeed objects are collections of key-value pairs but the key can only be a string. While the key of a Map can be of any type.\n\nIf for example, we use a number as a key in an object literal, that number is converted to a string and used as the key.\n\nBecause the key is converted to a string we get the same result when trying to get value for the 1 number value or for the '1' string value.  \n\n```js  \n    const obj = {\n        1: 'One',\n    }\n    console.log(obj[1]) // One\n\n    const map = new Map()\n    map.set(1, 'One')\n    console.log(map.get(1)) // One\n    console.log(map.get('1')) // undefined\n```  \n\nWhen using maps the key can be of any type so the 1 number key is different from the '1' string key\n\n```js  \n    const map = new Map()\n    map.set(1, 'One')\n    console.log(map.get(1)) // One\n    console.log(map.get('1')) // undefined\n```  \n\nThe key is unique in both cases. There cannot be two properties in an object with the same key or two entries in a map with the same key.  \n\n### 2. Maps preserve the order of their keys, objects do not\n\nThe original order of key-value pairs is preserved in maps, while in objects it is not.\n\n```js  \n    const gamesObj = {\n    2: 'Tzolkin',\n    1: 'Citadels',\n    };\n    const keys = Object.keys(gamesObj);\n    console.log(keys);\n    //[\"1\", \"2\"];\n    const keyValuePairs = Object.entries(gamesObj);\n    console.log(keyValuePairs);\n    //[\"1\", \"Citadels\"]\n    //[\"2\", \"Tzolkin\"]\n```  \n\nNotice that when the object is created the key 2 comes before the key 1. When retrieving all the keys 2 comes after 1.\n\nBelow is a similar collection built with the Map constructor. This time the initial order is preserved.\n\n```js  \n    const gamesMap = new Map([\n    [2, 'Tzolkin'],\n    [1, 'Citadels']\n    ])\n    const keys = gamesMap.keys();\n    console.log(keys);\n    //MapIterator {2, 1}\n    const keyValuePairs = gamesMap.entries();\n    console.log(keyValuePairs);\n    //MapIterator {2 => \"Tzolkin\", 1 => \"Citadels\"}\n\n```  \n","section":"10 Indexed collections"},{"title":"How can we check a value is a Array or not?","content":"## How can we check a value is a Array or not?\n\nThe Array.isArray() method determines whether the passed value is an Array object.\n\n```javascript\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nconsole.log(Array.isArray(arr)); // true\n\nvar obj = {};\nconsole.log(Array.isArray(obj)); // false\n\n```\n","section":"10 Indexed collections"},{"title":"How can we concatenated nested arrays?","content":"## How can we concatenated nested arrays?\n\nThe flat method is used to flatten an array.

A function to be executed every delay milliseconds. The first execution happens after delay milliseconds.\n\n ```javascript\n setInterval(() => {\n    console.log('Hello');\n    }, 1000);\n\n    // Hello\n    // Hello\n    // Hello\n    // Hello\n    // .......\n ```\n","section":"18 Client-side web APIs"},{"title":"Why do we use web workers?","content":"## Why do we use web workers?\n\nWeb workers are designed to let you run big jobs without freezing up the page. For example, imagine you want to do some complex calculations when someone clicks a button. If you start doing the job right away, you’ll tie everything up. The person using the page won’t be able to scroll or click anything.

Also  Closure is concept of function + lexical environment in which function it was created . so every function declared within the another function then it has access to the scope chain of outer function and the variables created within the scope of outer function will not get destroyed.\n\n```javascript\nfunction outerFunction(arg) {\n var outerVar = arg;\n return function innerFunction(innerArg) {\n  return outerVar + innerArg;\n };\n}\n\nvar innerFunction = outerFunction(10);\nconsole.log(innerFunction(20)); // 30\nconsole.log(innerFunction(30)); // 50\n```\n","section":"19 Closures"},{"title":"What are closures scope chains?","content":"## What are closures scope chains?\n\nClosures are functions that have access to the outer function’s variables even after the outer function has returned. This is useful when you want to return a function from a function and you want to be able to access the outer function’s variables.
